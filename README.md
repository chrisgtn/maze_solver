# Maze Solver Visualization

This Python project generates and solves mazes using depth-first search (DFS) algorithms, with real-time visualization built using Tkinter. The maze is generated with random wall breaking and then solved step-by-step, showing the pathfinding process from start to finish.

## Features
- **Random Maze Generation**: Generates a unique maze layout each time (or uses a fixed seed for reproducibility).
- **Real-Time Maze Solving**: Visualizes the DFS pathfinding process with red and gray lines for moves and backtracking.
- **Customizable Grid**: Easily adjust the number of rows, columns, and cell sizes.
